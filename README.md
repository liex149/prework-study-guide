## Description

The motivation was to attain knowledge as a new user. Reason for building this project was to learn how to use Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and how it all comes togther to create an end product. The problems that it solved was how to create a study guide to better prepare for this class while also doing some prework to get me into the mindset of coding. What I learned was how to navigate though different systems.

## Usage

The purpose of this study guide is to create a shortcut to figuring out what each language does and to review notes for each of the sections. Each topic contains a small note on what each section does (Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). We can open the DevTools console to see the JavaScript that is running. This will show a list of topics we have learned from the prework. You can also open Chrome DevTools using keyboard commands. If you’re using macOS, you can press Command+Option+I, and if you’re using windows, you can press Control+Shift+I.
